# Paralax
Paralax is a small game C# XNA I made based of Asteroids

Chances are you wont be able to open or compile the project properly but feel free to root around!
If you want to give it a go you can run it up in Paralax\Paralax\bin\x86\Debug
Try to get a score high enough that you don't get yelled at

I really enjoyed making this, I had to compile many different things I had learned with the most satisfying being collision detection and pathfinding
